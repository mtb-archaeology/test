	abstract = {This paper presents preliminary results of a program of archeological reconnaissance and testing in Crosby and Dickens Counties, Texas. The genesis of the project occurred when, during the week of Thanksgiving, 1966, the author had an opportunity to revisit several previously known sites in that vicinity and found that increasing interest in subsurface archeological remains on the part of local collectors was endangering many important sites. In that area—the region along the eastern edge of the Texas high plains often called "Caprock country"—surface sites abound, but due to prolonged subjection to heavy erosional activity, few locations remain where cultural materials are preserved in a stratified context. This lack, coupled with a near vacuum in the knowledge of post-Paleo-Indian prehistory of the area, made it doubly important that an attempt be made to salvage some of the data being threatened by relic hunters. Consequently, a contract was entered into by Southern Methodist University and the State Building Commission (under which the archeological program is supervised by state archeologist, Curtis Tunnell) providing funds for limited excavation and site survey in Crosby and Dickens Counties.

Work was begun two days after Christmas 1966 and continued through January 22, 1967. It had been originally planned that three sites be tested, with fairly extensive excavation being conducted at the Pete Creek Site (X41Cb1 and limited work being carried on at the Dockurn Springs Site (X41Dk1) and the Red Mud Creek Site (X41Dk2). It developed, however, that the Pete Creek Site, probably the most important of the three and certainly the one most threatened with destruction, consumed nearly all of the available time and funds. As a consequence, only survey reports of the Dickens County sites appear herein.

During reconnaissance a historic burial location was encountered. It is described as the Morgan Jones Site (X41Cb2).},

The project was supervised by Dessamae Lorrain with the assistance of Kathleen Gilmore.

The primary objective of this study was to correlate historical and archeological sources to determine the location of the miss ion and the original features of the presidio. Six weeks during the summer of 1967 were spent in research and one week was spent in the field, It was originally hoped that primary sources alone could be used for the historical research, but time limitations and difficulties in transcribing and translating handwritten eighteenth century Spanish documents precluded this.

All extant sources were searched for references to the location and physical features of the presidia and mission. When as many facts were gathered as time allowed, they were utilized in the field to determine the exact location of the mission and the existing features of the presidio. The location of the mission was not found, but it is hoped that further research and more time in the field will disclose the long sought site.},

	abstract = {In the 1850’s a chain of forts was established by the United States Army along the main road between San Antonio, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Regular travel over the road had begun in the late 1840’s when the close of the Mexican War paved the way for Anglo-American settlement of the Far Southwest. Then, after the opening of the California gold fields in 1849, traffic on the San Antonio–Santa Fe road became so brisk that the Army was called on to protect the travelers from the Apaches, Comanches, and other Indians that frequented the area.

Fort Lancaster was one of the forts designed to provide that protection. Situated in the Pecos River Valley in present-day Crockett County, Texas, this military outpost was established in 1855 and was abandoned by its Federal garrison at the beginning of the Civil War in 1861. Never again fully reactivated, the fort was occupied intermittently by transient Confederate troops during the war and, after 1865, was operated sporadically as a United States Army sub-post until final abandomnet in the 1880’s (Brown, 1965).

In June of 1966, archeological investigation of the site of old Fort Lancaster was undertaken by Southern Methodist University. The major project was excavation of a masonry barracks, primarily in search for architectural data to guide future reconstruction of the building as a museum and tourist reception center. Also excavated were three latrines which yielded a number of bottles, dishes, tools, and other objects useful for museum display. Small tests were dug in four other structures, but time did not permit their complete excavation. T.R. Hays, working under the general direction of Edward B. Jelks, supervised the field work.},
