It was felt that study of these changes could best be approached using the concepts and methods of cultural ecology.  Examination of the research area's environment, history, demography, land use, and social organization through the use of archival, historical and ethnological sources revealed a concomitant set of changes among these elements. 

Review of the historical pattern of change indicated that as land use changed from cotton farming to cattle production, demographic and economic changes contributed to the appearance of an "urbanized pattern of social organization. A set of hypotheses about the relationships among demographic, economic and land use variables was evaluated through bivariate correlation analysis indicated that land use and demographic changes were linked to changes in social organization.},

As a finite and endangered resource, archaeological sites must be managed under a carefully operated cultural resource management program. A regional approach to research and management problem represents the best way to plan the preservation and exploitation of archaeological sites. This study focuses on the question of prehistoric adaptation to 1:he prairie and cross timbers areas of North central Texas, and presents a regional synthesis and research designed oriented toward prehistoric adaptive response in the region. It is argued that archaeologists must take a general systems theory approach to the study of adaptation if they are going to understand the full range of adaptive responses in any region.},

	abstract = {The study of settlement patterns within defineable natural and cultural areas has rarely been pursued by American archaeologists. It was hypothesized that the Turtle Creek Watershed in Kerr County, Texas represented a natural area within which a prehistoric society would have been able to maintain itself. Approximately forty per cent of the watershed was surveyed by attendants of the Texas Archeological Society Summer Field Schools in 1971 and 1972. A total of 116 prehistoric sites were recorded and are evaluated in terms of the settlement model and the alter­ natives. It is determined that site size decreases as distance from the river increases but that the number of sites increases. Based on the survey data and upon con­ trolled collection of surface artifacts at six sites it is shown that sites within the watershed are functionally similar regardless of location or occupation period. 
Excavation of the two mound sites showed that the sites are functionally similar but that the internal structure of the sites is significantly different. Mound sites were not recorded on the river terrace and it is hypothesized that mounds are the remains of limited activities, specifically the cooking of large mammals. 
It is concluded that the Turtle Creek Watershed is not a natural or a cultural area because all maintenance activities were not conducted within the watershed. It is proposed that a larger land area is involved in the maximum subsistence/settlement area that includes the Turtle Creek Watershed. The importance of similar studies for salvage archaeology and for fu lfillin g the National Environmental Policy Act is discussed.},

	url_Paper = {https://smu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01SMU_INST/6ctoa/alma9931988463403716},
	abstract = {The social and political organization of the post-1700 Caddo in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana has been described as a series of matrilocal tribes united into two or more confederacies. A comparative analysis of four historic Indian confederacies yielded five traits characteristic of a unifying, or internally harmonizing, confederacy. Using data from late prehistoric sites, each of the five model traits is tested for presence in the Caddoan area or a sample portion of that area. Results indicate that all five of the traits are present. These are: (l) absence of social stratification, (2) presence of multiple distinct but spatially contiguous tribes in a confined area, (3) occurrence of vacant lands between population concentrations, (4) dependence on a vulnerable food crop, and (5) a scattered-hamlet settlement pattern.

It is known that the settlement pattern of the Caddo changed in the prehistoric period. This involved the abandonment of large mound sites and the adoption of a predominantly dispersed pattern, coincident with the disappearance of certain traits believed indicative of a strati­fied society. A major contributing cause is seen as the exhaustion of those few expanses of suitable soil large enough to support a stratified society.

A second major portion of the paper describes the excavations of two late Caddoan sites on the middle Sabine River. Data from this work and a nearby excavated site are used to test for the presence of a uxorilocal residence rule in these three villages. By introducing the concept of the familial microtradition, a detailed analysis of the pottery suggests that family groups can be detected in the archeological record, and that matrilocality was probably practiced.},
