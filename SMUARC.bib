Archaeological investigations have been performed in this area for the last 35 years. This report presents the results of a multidisciplinary investigation of a 4700 acre embankment and borrow pit area at Cooper Lake. Geophysical and geomorphological studies were undertaken to understand buried and relief features of the landscape, and the potential human use or occupation of these geomorphic features. Ethnohistorical interviews and archival and historical researches were performed to completely document the written information relating to previously occupied properties of the project area. Archaeological studies include archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological, osteological, malacological, and radiocarbon analyses; studies of lithic, ceramic, and other tool technologies; intra- and intersite spatial analyses; and, where possible, reconstruction of site and study area chronology, subsistence, and seasonality and duration of occupation.},

	title = {Archaeological, {Historical}, and {Architectural} {Investigations} of {Building} 2 ({41CF129}) at {Fort} {Brown}, {Brownsville}, {Texas}},
	abstract = {Archival research, architectural documentation, and archaeological test excavations were conducted between September 1990 and January 1991 on 41CF129 (Building 2) and its associated deposits. 41CF129 is a one-story, brick, load-bearing wall structure located on the former grounds of Fort Brown, Brownsville, Texas. This work was conducted for the General Services Administration, Region 7, Fort Worth, in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended). The building, while not listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register by the SHPO, making it subject to the requirements of 36 CFR 800. Plans for the expansion of the U.S. Customs facilities at the Brownsville Gateway Border Station threatened to impact 41CF129, and avoidance options that would permit it to remain standing at its original location were deemed unfeasible.

Architectural documentation of Building 2 was conducted in accordance with the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) Level I format. Photographs and inked drawings were used to record the structure in plan, profile, and elevation, and samples of mortar, paint, and plaster were taken to aid possible reconstruction efforts. Following architectural documentation, the structure was dismantled and placed in protective storage. Prior to dismantling, nineteen test units were excavated in order to assess the significance of archaeological deposits immediately surrounding Building 2. Following removal of Building 2, three more test units were emplaced in the footprint of the structure, in order to sample deposits sealed by its construction. 

Archival research revealed that Building 2 was constructed sometime between February 1882 and December 1884, rather than during the late 1860s or early 1870s, as previously thought. Although original designs called for a wood frame structure, brick masonry was employed instead, perhaps in response to damage sustained by other wood frame buildings at Fort Brown during an 1880 hurricane. Records indicate that Building 2 originally served as a schoolroom and library, and has subsequently functioned as a chapel, officers' guest quarters, noncommissioned officers' quarters, museum, maintenance shop, and storage space.

The 22 archaeological excavation units revealed that the upper 20.0 cm to 60.0 cm (7.8 in to 23.4 in) in the yard areas surrounding Building 2 consisted of redeposited sediment and building rubble resulting from mid- to late twentieth century landscape alterations, architectural demolition, and other construction activities. These recent events have removed or seriously disturbed cultural deposits associated with the late nineteenth and early twentieth century use of Building 2 over most of the tested area. However, those excavation units emplaced in the footprint of the building and, in at least one case, near the levee, revealed an intact, relatively undisturbed stratigraphic sequence. These units yielded artifacts and a cultural feature (pit) which indicate occupation in the immediate vicinity prior to the 1846 construction of the original Fort Brown. The recovered materials also suggest that a lightly framed wooden structure, perhaps jacale, occupied this area from the 1830s to perhaps the 1850s.},

	abstract = {Between September 1988 and March 1989, Southern Methodist University's Archaeology Research Program under contract from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted interim site rehabilitation and stabilization work for two structures at the Penn Farmstead (41DL192). The Penn Site is located in Cedar Hill State Park adjacent to Joe Pool Lake, Dallas County, Texas. It consists of 13 historic structures enclosed by chain link fence. 

Work at this site has involved the clearance of vegetation 2 to 15 years in age around all structures, drafting specifications for selective stabilization of portions of the 1859/1911 Penn House as well as the 1918 barn (including its schoolhouse and log house recycled as cribs), conducting specific stabilization tasks, documenting the work, and preparing a final report on the entire program. Architectural tasks were identified, specified, and the work observed under the coordination of Mr. Joe Freeman, A.I.A, of the Rio Group, Austin. 

This work has been conducted in accordance with and in partial fulfillment of Corps of Engineers obligation under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL 96-515) and the Archaeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL 93-291). The specific work required of this site is implemented under the Joe Pool Lake cultural resources Memorandum of Agreement dated January of 1984. The Joe Pool Lake Mitigation Plan, as attachment to the MOA, states that for the Penn Farm: "Buildings will be provided with new roofing and stabilization supports where necessary to preserve the integrity of the structures" (page J-13 of Contract Number DACW63-84-C-0146).},

	abstract = {This volume contains the summary report of the prehistoric archaeological and paleoecological investigations undertaken by the Archaeology Research Program of Southern Methodist University within the Joe Pool Lake Reservoir southwest of Dallas, Texas. Joe Pool Lake is being constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, for the purposes of flood control, recreation, and water supply. The archaeological investigations were conducted to mitigate the impact of the proposed construction of the floodwater retarding structure, associated park facilities, and the eventual inundation of the lake area. This report presents the results of the archaeological investigations of 6 prehistoric sites in the Joe Pool Lake project area under contract DACW63-84-C-0146.

The excavation of six sites within the project area revealed that the use of the Mountain Creek drainage was never very intensive during the prehistoric period. Excavation of sites 41DL189, 41DL184, and 41DL199 revealed primarily Late Archaic occupational refuse while the Cobb-Pool (41DL148) and Baggett Branch (41DL149) sites revealed distinctive Late Prehistoric occupations. Definition of occupational intensity, changing subsistence patterns, and activity was hindered by site contexts which have been altered by both cultural and natural forces through time. Nevertheless, sites 41DL199 and 41DL184 provide important evidence concerning site modification processes. Modification processes in the form of bioturbation (tree root action and rodent burrowing), pedoturbation (shrinking and swelling of clay soil) and cultural activities (digging of baking ovens) have produced the vertical distributions recognized at site 41DL199. The recognition of gilgai related pedofeatures at site 41DL184 and the profound effect of vertisolic movement on artifact contexts provides a new perspective upon the recognition of features and occupation surfaces within the Blackland prairie region of North Central Texas. 

The investigations of the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) revealed an adaptation not previously documented in the Prairie/Cross Timbers margin of North Central Texas. The short term nature of the site combined with a favorable depositional context have permitted the unique preservation of a significant portion of a horticultural community within the Mountain Creek drainage. Three probable house structures and associated features, an area for food processing and cooking within earth ovens, drying and/or storage platforms, and a likely refuse area comprise the community patterning of the Cobb-Pool site. The radiocarbon dates derived from charcoal suggest that the site was occupied during the first half of the thirteenth century.

The Baggett Branch site (41DL149) was also primarily occupied during the Late Prehistoric period. The depositional environment of the site, however, did not provide for the separation of the two, and perhaps three, occupations of the site. The latest occupation, dating to A.D. 1500, is characterized by the exploitation of bison, steeply chipped, "Plains" style end scrapers, and shell tempered ceramic wares similar to the Nocona Plain wares found to the north and west.

The discussion of the excavated sites is followed by Part III which presents the results of specialized studies. Magnetometer survey results, the geological context of the Mountain Creek drainage, raw material availability, and analyses of the lithic reduction strategies and projectile point variability are presented. The latter two sections present data sets which raise important questions concerning the interpretation of site function and regional interaction spheres. The Synthesis section which follows focuses on subsistence patterns represented by the Joe Pool Lake assemblages, an evaluation of the research design, and the placement of the Joe Pool Lake assemblages within a regional perspective.},

	abstract = {A background literature search and initial archaeological reconnaissance were performed for seven Plano Line Pl00 alternatives by the Archaeology Research Program, Southern Methodist University. This work was conducted under contract with Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Centec, Inc./DeLeuw, Cather \& Company (PBDC), DART's prime contractor. It was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit \# 625. A total of 56 blocks and adjacent streets were assessed for their archaeological resource potential using available literature, historical and archival information, and settlement patterning models. These blocks cover 100 acres and provide a broad area for assessing the archaeological impact potentials of the various P100 alternatives. Except at the Griffin Street Station, each line will generally have a total direct impact corridor of less than 50 ft. Within the surveyed area, 32 blocks were investigated in greater detail to reconstruct historic land use patterns over the last 140 years. These blocks contain about 35\% of the original 1850s townsite of Dallas. The various proposed alternatives for the P100 Line, excluding station areas, will impact at most about 0.8 acres of potentially significant blocks considered highly likely to yield important historic archaeological resources. Slightly less probable, but no less important, is the potential to encounter prehistoric sites along any one of the routes. Equally important. but less predictable are the types of archaeological and historical deposits buried in the moderate-to-low potential area identified to date. Archaeological preservation in these areas is expected to be unpredictable and less favorable due to twentieth century construction and land alterations. Approximately 35\% of the impact corridors of all P100 alternatives have absolutely no known or expected adverse archaeological impacts if constructed at their currently proposed rail grades (either "tunneled in rock" or constructed on the present surface grade). Predicted impact probabilities were compiled for all alternatives and revealed that no one alternative was totally free of likely adverse archaeological impacts based on current designs and information. Once a final design corridor is selected, a systematic program of archaeological testing should be implemented as soon as possible to identify the intact resources adversely impacted and to establish the proper mitigation program needed to address these resources.},

Extensive background research was conducted in which historic maps and archaeological reports were consulted to determine what kinds of sites might be present in the project area, and at what depth these sites were likely to occur. Fieldwork consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing. All creek bank exposures and erosional areas were visually inspected for artifacts and cultural features. Cultural materials were observed at two localities, but only one met criteria for assignment of a state site number. The first locality was an isolated find consisting of brick fragments and charcoal in a single shovel test. Additional shovel test in the surrounding area failed to uncover additional cultural materials. The other locality was a disturbed house site with art if acts dating primarily from the 1870s to the early 1900s which was assigned state trinomial 41DN249. A search of deed records at the Denton County Courthouse revealed that the property containing this site was patented to Thomas S. Rayburn in 1862, so the structure must post-date 1862. A few handfuls of artifacts were widely dispersed over a 200 m by 140 m area, and no structural -remains were present. The site has been plowed on an annual basis for at least 50 years, and appears to have relatively little potential for adding to our understanding of local history. However, the fact that a well is reported to have been visible during the early 1900s suggests that some intact features containing potentially significant information may be present. Therefore, it is recommended that a professional archaeologist monitor the construction within the site area to search for cultural features and test those that may be found.},

	abstract = {Archaeological investigations were conducted at 38 historical properties in the Richland/Chambers Reservoir betweenJune 1982 and January 1984 by the Archaeology Research Program, Southern Methodist University. The Reservoir, located in Navarro and Freestone Counties, is 100 km south of Dallas. It is under construction by the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One, Fort Worth, Texas, and will inundate up to 47,500 acres (19,200 hectares) along Richland and Chambers Creeks.

Recovery of significant data was conducted at a plantation site, 31 farmsteads, and 5 light industrial sites all dating between 1855 and World War II. In addition, limited explorations were undertaken to locate a historic cemetery. The breadth of study behind all of these investigations was outlined in the research design. It called for archaeological, architectural, documentary, and ethnographic studies in order to reconstruct some aspects of traditional life that have been poorly studied to date. Research objectives were focused on gathering detailed information on sheet refuse deposits, features, and other important site characteristics useful for studying nineteenth and early twentieth century living conditions and household possessions. Hypotheses cover topics ranging from local settlement patterns and intrasite structure to regional trends in material culture, architecture, and cultural geography.

The results of the researches have indicated that the Richland Creek Archaeological Project area was inhabited primarily by small landowners and tenant farmers practicing cotton agriculture. Settlement of the valley flanks and partially elevated bottomlands basically occurred after 1860 with the rural population becoming densest in the 1890 to 1920 period. The archaeological investigations revealed traditional lifeways that remained strongly entrenched in the area until the 1930s and 1940s. The layout of rural farmsteads contained a mixture of elements of the Upper and Lower South. The most pervasive archaeological feature encountered was sheet refuse which formed extensive yard middens covering 1,500 m2 to 3,500 m2 around many dwellings and contained an estimated 100,000 to 500,000 artifacts per site. Most of the farmsteads studied were occupied for 50 years or less. In contrast to these farmsteads, the industrial sites were fairly limited in the Project area and they were primarily associated with lumbering activities of the bottomland forest (i.e., briefly occupied sawmills), cotton ginning, or local brick making (i.e., small brick clamps). All but one of the industrial sites studied were occupied for less than 5 years.

The investigations of the 38 historical properties in the Richland/Chambers Reservoir provide very important data on rural lifeways and evidence of traditional living encoded in the archaeological record. Informants, documents, and written histories, combined with archaeological information, offer a more detailed picture of the local population than otherwise would be available. Cotton farming in North Central Texas was not the same as in most of the Deep South. Texas farmers were better off economically and materialistically. These differences provide an important signature for Texas households and offer a breadth of research opportunities for future researchers.},

	abstract = {Archaeological investigations were conducted at 15 prehistoric sites located within the
Richland/Chambers Reservoir. This work was performed by the Archaeology Research
Program, Southern Methodist University over the course of four field seasons between June
1982 and December 1984. The reservoir is located in Navarro and Freestone Counties, Texas, about 100 km southeast of Dallas. It is being constructed by the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One, and will inundate 44,750 acres along Richland and Chambers Creeks.

Part One of this volume presents the archaeological investigations at 13 of the prehistoric sites. Major excavations at two additional sites (Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch) are the subject of Volume II in the Richland Creek Technical Series. The investigations reported here record the remains of prehistoric occupations dating from the Late Paleo-Indian period (ca. 8000 B.C. - 600Q B.C.) through the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 700 - 1650), although evidence dating earlier than the Middle Archaic period (3000 B.C. - 1000 B.C.) is very limited. Artifact assemblages, habitation features, intrasite patterning, and subsistence remains document the activities of hunter-gatherer groups that occupied the reservoir area at various times during the past 5,000 years.

In Part Two, the results of the prehistoric site investigations are utilized to present a series of topical and synthetic statements concerning the prehistory of the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. Artifact assemblage data derived from stratified contexts and intersite comparisons, dated by a series of 48 radiocarbon determinations, allow the construction of a more detailed cultural chronology for the Middle Trinity River Basin. An analysis of lithic raw material utilization provides evidence of changes through time in hunter-gatherer group mobility and the size of exploitive territories. A technological analysis of lithic assemblages, integrated with the results of a lithic tool replication experiment, represents a continuing effort to define assemblage-specific lithic reduction strategies for the purpose of investigating intersite functional variability. Finally, the results of archaeological and paleoenvironmental investigations are used to develop a diachronic model of hunter-gatherer adaptations to the changing physical and cultural environments of the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area.},

The Reservoir, located inNavarro and Freestone Counties, is 100 km south of Dallas. It is under construction by the Tarrant County Water Control andImprovement District Number One, Fort Worth, Texas, and will inundate 47,500 acres (19,200 hectares) along Richland and Chambers Creeks.

Recovery of architectural data was conducted for 26 dwellings, 4 bridges, and 12 special purpose structures, all dating between 1848 and World War II. In addition, dendrochronological samples were taken from 22 structures, producing 80verified tree-ring dates. Thirteen structures received construction dates. The tree-ring samples yielded several master ring chronologies that provided climatic information on local rainfall patterns and late spring frosts from 1634 to 1980.

In addition to the above architectural studies, ethnographic, archival, and specialized artifacts analyses were carried out during the course of the Project. Window glass fragments were quantified and provided important socioeconomic and temporal information for many of the sites. Nails from sheet refuse contexts also provided information useful for reconstructing some buildings that had long since vanished. Refined earthenwares (i.e., ironstones, whitewares, and tinted wares) and stonewares yielded information about household preferences and traditional foodway practices. Ironstones and whitewares revealed strong, conservative preferences for plain, undecorated wares until the early twentieth century. Stoneware sherds occurred primarily in pre-1920 components and exhibited considerable temporal patterning among various glaze and vessel forms.Faunal remains revealed a much higher consumption of beef for nineteenth century black households than originally expected. Animal remains also indicated that hunting supplied some additional varieties of meats, but that the consumption of wild species was a marginal part of all households. Finally, small finds and low frequency artifact categories such as tools, farm equipment parts, personal items, and so forth, provided a personal glimpse into some specific household possessions.Many of these categories also revealed socioeconomic preferences for modest material items, often related to specific household and farm activities (e.g., sad irons, cooking vessels and flatware, horse and stable gear, wagon and machine parts). 

Few nonessential items were found.The results of all of these studies provide detailed information on many aspects of rural life not highly documented in other records. The layout of farmsteads in North Central Texas conveys a personal picture of the small landowner and tenant farmer, both of whom struggled against rising competition, falling cotton prices, the boll weevil, and finally, mechanization. The archaeological and architectural records contain subtle information on how these households coped with the agricultural technological revolution of the nineteenth and twentieth century. The material record indicates that North CentralTexas farm tenants diverged from farmsteads in other older cotton producing areas in layout, material possessions, and architecture. The Richland Creek Archaeological Project has focused on the material evidence of these differences, and incorporated archival and oral information to provide a synergistic picture of rural life along Richland and Chambers Creeks from the 1850s to the 1920s.},

Background information on the Richland Creek Archaeological Project (RCAP) is presented in this volume. The structure and function of the laboratory used during fieldwork phases is discussed, and recommendations are given for the efficient analysis of large datasets. Two recommendations are considered most important in terms of operating a laboratory for a large cultural resources program: (1) ensure that ample planning and development time are allowed, and (2) run the lab concurrently with the fieldwork. The former item is largely self-explanatory; without proper preparation, laboratory procedures will be poorly developed and the overall lab will function inefficiently. The second recommendation, operating a laboratory concurrently with the fieldwork, permits the results of analysis to be promptly provided to the field crews. This, in turn, permits rapid changes to be made in field procedures as new research opportunities are revealed.

This volume also presents the research designs for the prehistoric and historic investigations in the RCAP. Prehistoric research within the Upper Trinity Basin is discussed as a background to the presentation of the prehistoric research design. The hypotheses for this work are divided into two groups: those that deal with culture-historical issues, and those that deal with processual issues. The hypotheses are formally tested in later volumes as relevant data are presented. Historic research objectives center on obtaining information concerning sheet refuse deposits, features, and other important characteristics of sites dating from A.D. 1850 to World War II. Hypotheses are presented which cover topics ranging from local settlement patterns and intrasite structure to regional trends in material culture, architecture, and cultural geography.

Considerable research was conducted for the RCAP on the present and past environment, and the implications of this research for human settlement of the Prairie Margin are discussed.Significant changes in the climate arid botanical resources of the Prairie Margin were observed when paleoecological data from within and around the RCAP were analyzed. Prior to A.D.1200, a wetter environmental period was inferred which was followed by a trend towards gradual drying of the climate on a regional level. Massive erosion of the terraces and uplands has been observed within the last 150 years due to historic land clearing and cultivation.  Reconstruction of the biotic resources of the Project area based on Texas General Land OfficeRecords shows that the Prairie Margin throughout the RCAP consisted of a complex mosaic of prairie and woodlands.

Finally, the geological research in and around the reservoir indicates that the RichlandCreek valley was scoured during the Pleistocene and alluviated during the Holocene. As a result, significant buried archaeological sites are expected to exist within the floodplain.Although several of these were investigated during the survey and testing phases of the Project, it was not feasible to investigate the deeper sites (greater than 10 m). Upland and terrace sites have largely formed on stable land surfaces, and little potential for culturally relevant stratigraphy exists, although useful archaeological data can still be collected on these landforms.},

	abstract = {The archaeological investigations undertaken at two of the prehistoric archaeological sites within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir (Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch) are discussed in this volume. These two sites have been included in a single volume because they both possess large features (ca. 16 m in diameter and more than 2 m deep) that are similar in form and content to the Wylie focus pits found along the East Fork of the Trinity River nearDallas. The features along the East Fork have been the subject of numerous speculations, but only limited investigations. A major goal of the Richland Creek Archaeological Project wasto examine further the hypothesized functions of such features by careful investigation of the features at Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch. The field work was conducted between June1982 and December 1984, by the Archaeology Research Program, Southern MethodistUniversity. The reservoir, located in Navarro and Freestone Counties, is 100 km south ofDallas. It is under construction by the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement DistrictNumber One, Fort Worth, Texas, and will inundate 44,750 acres along Richland and Chambers Creeks.

The Bird Point Island site contained significant archaeological deposits relating to habitation, with four major periods of site use observed. First, sporadic use of the site occurred during the Late Archaic period (170 B.C. - A.O. 130). The large feature was excavated and used for roasting food and for human burial during this time. The next major use of the site occurred during the Richland Creek phase (A.D. 580 - 860). Primary evidence for this period occurs inside the large feature, which was used for cremation burials and for trash deposition.The following Round Prairie phase occupation (A.D. 1000-1200) consisted of a sedentary hamlet of three houses. Significant economic data were recovered from this occupation which indicated that the inhabitants existed solely on a diet of wild plants and animals, with primary reliance on hickory nuts, acorns, Psoralea tubers, and deer. The final occupation ofthe site occurred during the St. Elmo phase (A.D. 1300 - 1650). Several periods of short-term site habitation took place during this time, and a shift to a more mobile settlement pattern characterized by seasonal use of the sites seems to have occurred. The economic pattern of theRound Prairie phase continued, except that some maize was introduced into the diet. The very small quantity of maize suggests that it was a minor supplement to the diet.

No house patterns were identified at Adams Ranch; the most significant data were recovered from within the large feature. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the feature was first excavated around A.D. 200, during the Late Archaic period. Shell tempered sherds were discovered in the bottom layer of feature fill (dating between A.D. 200 and 700); however, none were found atBird Point Island. This suggests that the pit at Adams Ranch was excavated at a later point in time, after the introduction of ceramics. The most intensive occupation of the site occurred during the early Round Prairie phase (A.D. 800 - A.D. 1000). Most of the features and artifacts recovered from the large depression date to this period. Grog/grit and bone tempered ceramics replaced shell tempered ware during this period, and arrow points were used along with dart points. The distribution of these artifacts across the site indicates that most other features at Adams Ranch also date to the early Round Prairie phase. Only limited occupation occurred after A.D. 1000 during the St. Elmo phase. Economic data indicate that a hunting/gathering lifestyle based on a diet of deer, acorns, nuts, and Psoralea tubers persisted throughout all periods of occupation. Unlike Bird Point Island, no evidence of maize was recovered at Adams Ranch.

The final part of this volume discusses the Wylie focus concept. This construct was originally defined in 1952 to classify several sites with large, man-made depressions observed along the East Fork of the Trinity River. It was characterized by a trait list which included the presence of large pits, ceramics, and flexed burials without grave goods. The data obtained from the similar features at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites have added significant information on the function of such large depressions. The features are now believed to date to the Late Archaic period, when they functioned as roasting pits for interband feasting and as cemeteries, which may have also served as territorial markers. The new assignment of these large features to the Late Archaic period casts doubt on the usefulness of the Wylie focus as it was originally defined, and calls into question its validity as a meaningful archaeological construct.},

	abstract = {A cultural resources survey of the 69.5-acre Wynnwood Park, adjoining Lewisville Lake, Denton County, Texas was undertaken by the Archaeology Research Program, Southern Methodist University, on behalf of the Fort Worth District, U. S.Army Corps of Engineers. A one-week pedestrian survey of the park was carried out by a four-man crew during April of 1985. This was immediately followed by a one-week program of limited shovel testing and evaluation of potentially significant sites. Thirteen sites were recorded within the Wynnwood Park area, consisting of twelve historic sites and one multicomponent prehistoric/historic site. This data suggests a limited utilization of the Wynnwood Park area during the prehistoric Archaic period(ca. 6000 B.C. - A.D. 600), an initial historic white occupation around 18.50 .±. 5 years followed by an apparent abandonment, and continuous occupation of the area beginning circa 1890 and lasting until the construction of Lewisville Lake in the 1950s. Comparisons of the Wynnwood Park data with that from surrounding areas to the north and south, suggest a pattern of broadly similar rural folkways existed throughout all ofNorth Central Texas during the latter part of the nineteenth century and the early part of' the twentieth century. Of the thirteen sites located and recorded by the Wynnwood Park Survey, four are judged to be significant and potentially eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.},

	abstract = {Archaeological data recovery was conducted in 1982 for 33 National Register eligible historical properties in the Richland/Chambers Reservoir Project area underAntiquities Permit 312. The work was performed by the Archaeology ResearchProgram, Southern Methodist University, under the direction of Dr. L. Mark Raab (Principal Investigator). Mitigation of historical properties was sponsored by the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One; the agency also responsible for construction of the reservoir. All of the archaeological properties intensively investigated were previously identified as significant and as adversely affected by construction (Archaeology Research Program 1981, 1982).

The field work and analyses covered by this report constitute the first of four seasons scheduled for carrying out the mitigation plan. About 28\% of the entire plan was completed in 1982, involving 720 person days of field work, 330 person days labwork, and 225 person days for analyses and write-up. Intensive investigations at 16 ofthe 33 historical properties studied in 1982 are complete (41FT132, 41FT143, 41FT156, 41FT157, 41FT163, 41FT225, 41FT228, 41FT231, 41NV74, 41NV161, 41NV293, 41NV294, 41NV334, 41NV37l, and 41NV378) and we recommend no additional work at these sites.The remaining properties can be divided into three groups: six requiring minor additional archaeological data recovery (41NV54, 41NV101, 41NV102, 41NV250,41 NV267, 41 NV306), seven requiring minor additional dendrochronological analyses(41FT219, 41 NV77, 41 NV209, 41 NV223, 41 NV238, 41 NV293, 41 NV336), and four requiring all of the above (41FT164, 41NV239, 41NV258, 41NV289). Details on specific recommendations are given in the text.

Major results of the mitigation program conducted for historical properties in1982 were achieved in the following four areas. First, intensive data recovery of sheet refuse around 10 dwellings identified major intrasite patterning shared by 80\% of the sites examined to date. In addition, systematic samples of yard deposits provide strong empirical evidence of stability of several segments of rural agricultural lifeways for a period covering nearly a century (ca. 1860s to l 940s). Second, architectural examinations have revealed that the Project area represents a separate rural sociocultural zone distinct from upland communities and primarily made up of small landowners and tenant farmers. Third, dendrochronological analyses of elements of historical structures have been successful in 30\% of the cases applied to date. This represents a major breakthrough since the majority of our work has been focused on frame dwellings. Fourth and last, focused archival research and informant interview shave revealed the probable limits and benefits of these sources for interpreting archaeological properties.

The following report represents an interim report originally conceived as a partial management tool for our own personal use as well as various review agencies.Four months ago, it was forecasted as being minimal in length and content; something on the order of 45 day reports previously prepared (e.g., Archaeology Research Program 1981; Raab, Moir, and McGregor 1980). Since then, the volume has grown to be much more in content and length and should be of greater benefit to all involved.Still, this report is not intended to provide a final synthesis of research results.Rather, interim reports of the kind presented here are designed to direct the research trends of the Project. In this scheme, they are part of a research design that is intended to be improved and modified as work progresses. Ultimately, a series of interim technical reports (such as the attached) will serve as a source of investigative continuity for assembling a final report of the Project results in 1985 in fulfillment of the Richland/Chambers Project Antiquities Permit.},

	abstract = {The following report is a synthesis of archaeological investigations in the Lakeview Lake Project area. Following an archaeological survey of the project (Phase One) by Skinner and Connors ( 1979; see below), sequential years oftest excavations \{\vphantom{\}}Phase Two, 1979; and Phase Three, 1980) were carried out The results of Phase Two and Three investigations were accumulated in two annual reports (Raab, Bruseth and McIntyre 1979; Ferring and Reese 1979 and Raab, McGregor and McIntyre 1979; F erring and Reese 1980). One of our tasks here is to synthesize the last two of years of investigation into a coherent statement. This job was made difficult because, as to be expected in any scientific enterprise, methods and objectives tended to evolve with increases in information. At the same time, however, we have attempted to keep such growth orderly by relating the investigations to central research design concepts. These are presented in detail. Some differences in approach and emphasis are apparent from one investigative stage to the next and these are an indication of changing research activities. 
All of these studies were carried out under the terms of Contract No. DACW63- 78-C-009 and subsequent modifications with the Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. 
The fundamental objective was to harness the evolving research program mentioned above into a program that would ( 1) identify archaeological properties significant in relation to the criteria of eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, (2) formulate a reasonably clear projection of impacts of proposed construction in these properties, and (3) offer a series of resource management recommendations. 
A dimension of variability in the archaeological work is the fact that work was divided between prehistoric and historic studies. The Archaeology Research Program of SMU was the prime contractor, and concerned itself with the prehistoric component of the work. The Institute of Applied Sciences of North Texas State University was a subcontractor to SMU, and investigated the historic sites. This division of labor in no way implies a value judgement about the relative merit of the two kinds of resources, but does reflect the fact that quite different kinds of expertise are at times required to deal with one or the other. The division does reflect an attempt to use differing areas of interest and expertise to best advantage. Accordingly, the report is divided into prehistoric and historic sections.},

Examination of the research area's environment, history, demography, land use, and social organization through the use of archival, historical and ethnological sources revealed a concomitant set of changes among these elements.

Review of the historical pattern of change indicated that as land use changed from cotton farming to cattle production, demographic and economic changes contributed to the appearance of an "urbanized pattern of social organization". A set of hypotheses about the relationships among demographic, economic and land use variables was evaluated through bivanate correlation analysis indicated that land use and demographic changes were linked to changes in social organization.},

	abstract = {In April 1977, the Sacramento District Office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contracted with the Archaeology Research Program of Southern Methodist University to implement an evaluation of the cave resources to be impacted by the future NewMe/ones Reservoir. Located in Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties, California, the reservoir is projected to inundate a considerable amount of cavernicolous karst terrain. In addition, numerous caves are known to exist in the adjacent areas to be set aside for recreational and similar purposes.

The field phase, most of which was completed in April and May, first emphasized the study of known caves of archaeological value. The preliminary results of this study were published in June (McEachern and Grady, 1977). The remainder of the field work was directed toward an interdisciplinary inventory and evaluation of the other known caves within the project area. Following the field work, the data were synthesized by a core of research specialists assisted by consultants familiar with particular aspects of speleology. This report represents the results of the study.

In all, 87 caves were investigated. Although evaluations stressed geological, paleontological, taphonomic, biological, archaeological, and historical importance, esthetic values and recreational potential were also considered. Significance was assessed on the basis of National Register of Historic Places and National Registry of Natural Landmarks guidelines. From these data, mitigation recommendations were provided.

Due to the exceedingly valuable nature of the cave resource base, particularly froma biological perspective, it was concluded that adequate mitigation could not be implemented within the time schedule currently being followed for project completion. Thus, it was recommended that actual impoundment in the karst area not occur until such mitigation can be completed-2½ years from the time ameliorative study can be initiated.},

Bioturbation has seriously damaged the explanatory potential of three sites. The remaining site is inferred to be a primary lithic procurement station, and is sufficiently preserved to warrant additional investigations.},

	abstract = {Archaeological research in the Elm Creek drainage was designed to locate, record, and evaluate cultural resources which will be affected by the construction of ten proposed floodwater retarding structures. The multi-phase project was initiated with a literature search. The second phase of the study consisted of a systematic total survey of the area to be directly affected by the proposed project. One hundred and eight historic and prehistoric sites were re-corded. At the end of the survey phase, a research design aimed at examining technological-functional variability in the Elm Creek water-shed was developed. The third phase of the study consisted of a variety of testing methods designed to implement the research design. Laboratory analysis of the data collected during the projects was also designed to reflect on the research design. The interpretation offered in this report suggests that at the level of technological-functional activities, considerable variation is present among the sites examined in the Elm Creek drainage.},

	abstract = {Pursuant to an agreement between the Fort Concho Museum andSouthern Methodist University, members of the Archaeology ResearchProgram initiated an archaeological study of certain features with-in the fort complex. The project was developed in three phases, the first of which was a review of documents concerning the features under investigation. Of primary concern were placement and condition of the original company streets, the condition of certain of the buffalo walls, and the precise location of the fort hospital. The second phase was a testing program designed to locate and evaluate the status of these features. Report production was the third stage.The report details the results of the first two phases and provides recommendations for the future disposition of the material remains in light of proposed development plans.

Conclusive evidence was found indicating that the company streets are in most cases intact and could be restored with a mini-mum of effort. The buffalo walls were not so well preserved; and although evidence of their presence was located, almost complete re-construction would be necessary for these to become a permanent part of the facility. The hospital could not be located, and recommendations are provided to direct more educated efforts towards the location. It is further recommended in conclusion that problem-oriented research goals be developed as part of future planning that will im-pact the archaeological data base of the fort.},

	abstract = {During portions of 1975 an archaeological survey was conducted on 27,690 acres of land which will be inundated by construction of Lake Fork Reservoir, northeastern Texas. One hundred, thirty sites were located. Testing, consisting of surface collection, postholes and/or test pits, was conducted at 65 of the sites located during survey. The purpose of this work was to assess the archaeological resources of the reservoir and to make recommendations for mitigation.

Occupation of the reservoir spans the Archaic (3,500B.C. to A.D. 500), Neo-American (A.D. 500 to 1650),and Historic (A.D. 1650 to the present) periods. Intersite analysis demonstrated that sites with predominantly lithics are located mostly along and within Lake Fork Creek floodplain, and predominantly ceramic sites are located primarily along tributaries of Lake Fork Creek. Two models of prehistoric subsistence-settlement systems are offered to explain the distribution of lithic and ceramic sites. Thirteen sites are recommended for further work during mitigation.},

	abstract = {Archaeological survey in a relatively unstudied section of southeastern New Mexico has located 92 archaeological sites,77 of which were prehistoric and 15 of which were occupied within the last century. Four separate models are discussed centering on different levels of investigation. One model attempts a synthesis of environmental change and cultural responses in the Middle Pecos region. A second model investigates an ethnographic example of aboriginal occupation in the Middle Pecos and proposes ways in which this knowledge may be made into a predictive model for prehistoric subsistence and settlement systems. A third model investigates a site typology and functional explanation for prehistoric sites in the Brantley Reservoir survey sample of sites. A fourth model investigates the patterned variability of artifacts on one specific site in the survey area which was partially collected in controlled grid units. These four models correspond fairly closely with differing levels of abstraction and proposed directions for further study in the mitigation of destruction of archaeological resources to be affected by Brantley Reservoir.},

Both the probable prehistoric environment and the surrounding cultures were used as interpretive settings for the occupations.A tentative model of regional development, cultural succession and eventual collapse is suggested, It is quite possible that overcrowding, with the resultant depletion of resources, resulted in apparent regional abandonment shortly before European contact.},

Detailed analysis of lithic debris shows that there are different tool making processes represented at the sites and these patterns are not adequately reflected by the tool assemblage. It is concluded that the settlement system along the Sabine River included small seasonal villages as well as burial and mound sites.},

Archeological investigation of the nineteenth-century salt furnaces which were used at the saline was carried out in1969 by Southern Methodist University prior to the raising of the level of Lake Palestine Reservoir. Eight furnace locations and ten furnaces were recorded during the survey of the saline. Excavation at the Emerald Bay site revealed the internal structure of a salt furnace as well as a series of later modifications. The place of the Neches Saline in the economy of the Trans-Mississippi South is discussed, and recommendations for modification of current research design are presented.},

Remaining sites have Frankston Focus ceramics and include a number of settlements interpreted as permanent hamlet or village localities. These are predominantly associated with streamside locations near relatively fertile soils the site situation described for the Hasinai, who occupied the upper Neches historically.  Other Caddoan sites are suggested as equivalents of seasonally-occupied localities in the Hasinai settlement system.

After this model was constructed field research was done by searching for a site which would coincide with the model. An area in Milam County, Texas between the San Gabriel River and Brushy Creek coincided with part of the model and excavations were made at a site postulated for one of the missions to test the validity of the model. The findings from the excavations were compared to the model and the comparisons conformed enough to conclude that the precise location of one of the missions had been identified.The project was financed by the State Building Commission through the State Archeologist, and was handled through Southern Methodist University.},

	abstract = {This paper presents preliminary results of a program of archeological reconnaissance and testing in Crosby and Dickens Counties, Texas. The genesis of the project occurred when, during the week of Thanksgiving, 1966, the author had an opportunity to revisit several previously known sites in that vicinity and found that increasing interest in subsurface archeological remains on the part of local collectors was endangering many important sites. In that area—the region along the eastern edge of the Texas high plains often called "Caprock country"—surface sites abound, but due to prolonged subjection to heavy erosional activity, few locations remain where cultural materials are preserved in a stratified context. This lack, coupled with a near vacuum in the knowledge of post-Paleo-Indian prehistory of the area, made it doubly important that an attempt be made to salvage some of the data being threatened by relic hunters. Consequently, a contract was entered into by Southern Methodist University and the State Building Commission (under which the archeological program is supervised by state archeologist, Curtis Tunnell) providing funds for limited excavation and site survey in Crosby and Dickens Counties.

Work was begun two days after Christmas 1966 and continued through January 22, 1967. It had been originally planned that three sites be tested, with fairly extensive excavation being conducted at the Pete Creek Site (X41Cb1 and limited work being carried on at the Dockurn Springs Site (X41Dk1) and the Red Mud Creek Site (X41Dk2). It developed, however, that the Pete Creek Site, probably the most important of the three and certainly the one most threatened with destruction, consumed nearly all of the available time and funds. As a consequence, only survey reports of the Dickens County sites appear herein.

During reconnaissance a historic burial location was encountered. It is described as the Morgan Jones Site (X41Cb2).},

The primary objective of this study was to correlate historical and archeological sources to determine the location of the miss ion and the original features of the presidio. Six weeks during the summer of 1967 were spent in research and one week was spent in the field, It was originally hoped that primary sources alone could be used for the historical research, but time limitations and difficulties in transcribing and translating handwritten eighteenth century Spanish documents precluded this.

All extant sources were searched for references to the location and physical features of the presidia and mission. When as many facts were gathered as time allowed, they were utilized in the field to determine the exact location of the mission and the existing features of the presidio. The location of the mission was not found, but it is hoped that further research and more time in the field will disclose the long sought site.},

	abstract = {In the 1850’s a chain of forts was established by the United States Army along the main road between San Antonio, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Regular travel over the road had begun in the late 1840’s when the close of the Mexican War paved the way for Anglo-American settlement of the Far Southwest. Then, after the opening of the California gold fields in 1849, traffic on the San Antonio–Santa Fe road became so brisk that the Army was called on to protect the travelers from the Apaches, Comanches, and other Indians that frequented the area.

Fort Lancaster was one of the forts designed to provide that protection. Situated in the Pecos River Valley in present-day Crockett County, Texas, this military outpost was established in 1855 and was abandoned by its Federal garrison at the beginning of the Civil War in 1861. Never again fully reactivated, the fort was occupied intermittently by transient Confederate troops during the war and, after 1865, was operated sporadically as a United States Army sub-post until final abandomnet in the 1880’s (Brown, 1965).

In June of 1966, archeological investigation of the site of old Fort Lancaster was undertaken by Southern Methodist University. The major project was excavation of a masonry barracks, primarily in search for architectural data to guide future reconstruction of the building as a museum and tourist reception center. Also excavated were three latrines which yielded a number of bottles, dishes, tools, and other objects useful for museum display. Small tests were dug in four other structures, but time did not permit their complete excavation. T.R. Hays, working under the general direction of Edward B. Jelks, supervised the field work.},

A second model investigates an ethnographic example of aboriginal occupation in the Middle Pecos and proposes ways in which this knowledge may be made into a predictieve model for prehistoric subsistence and settlement systems. A third model investigates a site typology and functional explanation for prehistoric sites in the Brantley Reservoir survey sample of sites. A fourth model investigates the patterned variability of artifacts on one specific site in the survey area which was partially collected in controlled grid units. These four models correspond fairly closely with differing levels of abstraction and proposed directions for further study in the mitigation of destruction of archaeological resources to be affected by Brantley Reservoir.},

	abstract = {The Summer 1972 excavations in the area of the proposed Cooper Lake, northeast Texas, constituted the second phase of a multi-stage project designed to collect important archaeological data prior to destruction by dam construction, flooding, and related activities. The purpose of this phase of the research was to clarify the model of prehistoric utilization of the study area developed from site survey data (Hyatt and Skinner 1971:46). Excavations were designed to test the implications of site size relative to function. Different size sites in similar geographical areas were tested for differences in site activity patterning. In addition, particular attention was given to recovery of data relevant to seasonality and chronology.

During the ten week excavation season four sites were investigated.  The Lawson site (X41HP7) was partially excavated, the Cox and Thomas sites (X41HP37 and X41DT68) were systematically surface collected and partially excavated, and the Ewing site (X41DT57) was tested and determined to be inadequate for application to the specific problems under consideration.

The research design has been evaluated on the basis of new data, and no revision is indicated at this time. A change in method is suggested in order to provide a more reliable means of determining excavation loci that will lead to a more efficient recovery of data relevant to the problems being studied.},

Five previously recorded Historic period sites (41FT86, 41FT117, 41FT121, 41FT130, and 41LN227) in the Jewett Permit area were tested to assess their eligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Only one property, 41FT86, had standing architecture, and comments from Texas Historical Commission (THC) architects were solicited for its National Register evaluation.

The historic archaeological deposits at 41FT86, 41FT117, 41FT121, and 41FT130 were recommended not of sufficient quality or association to make any one of them eligible for nomination to the National Register. Consequently, no further archaeological work was recommended for these four sites. Site 41LN227, the homesteadof the Hardy Webb family from the 1880s to ca. 1910, was recommended for nomination to the NRHP. Data recovery was initiated at 41LN227 in August 1988 and was completed in November 1988},

	abstract = {From August 1989 to June 1990, the Archaeology Research Program of Southern Methodist University conducted extensive archival research and intensive field investigations of portions of a four-block area which was to be impacted by the Texas Capitol Extension Project. During the course of these excavations, ca. 72 backhoe trenches and 140 hand excavated lm by lm (3.28 ft by 3.28 ft) units were emplaced in the project area. These excavations and attendant archival research documented the remains of 64 buildings and 61 other architectural features. The investigations yielded some 81,039 artifacts and 32,709 faunal remains.

The archaeological and archival data analyzed by the Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute indicates that the Capitol Extension project area was initially visited, probably repeatedly, by Native American populations at least as early as Middle Archaic times, ca. 3500-1000 B.C., and that the historic occupation of this area dates ca A.D. 1855-1960. Throughout its historic occupational sequence, the Capitol Extension study area served primarily-but not exclusively-as a residential area for a middle class to moderately affluent population which, for the most part, worked in or was otherwise connected to the state government. 

The extant archaeological and historic record of the project area documents the evolution of a portion of Austin into a bona fide urban area, reflecting in microcosm a many of the forces which were then transforming Austin at large.},

Using information fromLake Monticello and Lake Bob Sandlin excavations, a settlement model is proposed for the late prehistoric period Caddoan manifestation known as the Titus Focus.

The area was abandoned at the end of the Early Caddo period and never reoccupied to any significant degree, although there was limited occupation around the turn of the twentieth century. All archaeological sites within this area are deemed eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, however, it is the conclusion of this study that additional field investigations at Cooper Lake are not necessary in order to further mitigate the loss of the archaeological resources which will be inundated when the lake is constructed. It is recommended that the available excavated data are worthy of further analysis and syntheses, and that the lithic artifacts should be analyzed in order to evaluate the sources of raw materials.},

	abstract = {Archaeological and historical investigations were conducted for 13 historic and 5 prehistoric properties (see Volume I) in the Joe Pool Lake project area between October, 1984 and July, 1986 by the Archaeology Research Program, Institute for the Study of Earth and Man, Southern Methodist University. Joe Pool Lake will impound 7,400 acres along Mountain and Walnut Creeks in Dallas, Tarrant, Ellis, and Johnson Counties. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District constructed the lake to provide flood protection. An additional 5,100 acres of park lands will also provide recreation facilities for Dallas and Fort Worth.

Historic archaeological investigations were conducted to mitigate adverse project impacts identified for 13 historic properties dating from the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and determined eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Archaeological and architectural studies were focused on 9 landowners' farmsteads and 4 tenant farmers' dwellings. Historic sites with mid-nineteenth century components included Loyd (41TR39), Anderson (41DL190), and Penn (41DL192). Late nineteenth century components were present at these 3 sites, as well as Lowe (41TR40), Reitz (41TR45), Marrs (41TR48), Holveck (41DL183), Pool (41DL191), Titterington Tenant (41DL267) and Titterington (41DL268). Sites with predominantly twentieth century occupations were Bowman (41TR42), Hintze (41DL181), and Hintze Tenant (41DL196).

Investigations were focused on the archaeological features, sheet refuse, architecture, archival records, and oral information related to these 13 properties. This interdisciplinary research was focused on gathering detailed information on local settlement and traditional lifeways using the 13 sites as a data base. An explicit research design was formulated to focus all of these studies and to provide a framework for deriving important results.

Most of the sites selected for study consisted of white landowners' farmstead complexes with above average landholdings and large layouts. Sheet refuse deposits common to rural Texas farmsteads were not as dense as those recently identified in other rural areas of North Central Texas. The large farmstead layouts have tended to disperse sheet middens across broad areas, making artifact densities light in any one spot.

Root cellars and storm cellars were common; stonelined well shafts and frame granaries were also very common. Based on architectural investigations, horizontal log construction was not a common technique used on the North Central Texas Frontier. Instead, hewn and sawn timber frame buildings using mortise and tennon joinery was the dominant construction technique. The four tenant sites revealed smaller, but denser, sheet refuse middens and compact active yards. Brick was common on all sites and at the Anderson Plantation was used to construct a large, elaborate storm cellar. All farm tenant sites were occupied by white families based on oral information. No black or hispanic tenant sites were among the group of sites identified for receiving data recovery. General Land Office records provided a means of reconstructing the initial land divisions and the vegetation at the time of settlement.

The archaeological and architectural resources of Joe Pool Lake contain information on the evolution of a rural agrarian area near to a major urban center. This Mountain Creek region is comparatively unique for North Central Texas in terms of its topographical and ecological setting. The Joe Pool Lake historical investigations provide an initial understanding of the rich history of this area and the long farming traditions that were pursued until the 1920s.},

Extensive excavation of the Arnold Site and the Ranger Site has revealed that larger artifact samples bear out the same functional attributes as shown through the limited testing of sites within the lake area.The collection of a large faunal assemblage from the Arnold Site has shown that contrary to expectations, the site was occupied during all seasons. The site contains a cemetery area with 12 individuals, and the deposit appears to have built up over several hundred years. Occupation of the Sulphur River floodplain environs was apparently more intense than previously understood, and the postulated bottom-land flooding does not seem to have been a major hindrance to flood-plain occupation. The regional settlement pattern remains to be evaluated after conducting an investigation of sites located in the uplands. However, current evidence suggests that the Cooper Lake area represents either the location of a marginal Caddoan development or the location of only part of a settlement/subsistence system.},

	abstract = {The archaeological investigations of the proposed excavation and construction area for the John. F. Kennedy Exhibit addition to the Dallas County Administration Building (otherwise known as the Texas School Book Depository), Dallas, Texas, were conducted from late December 1987 to February 1988. A background literature search and initial archaeological reconnaissance of the study area-which encompasses Dallas' Block 10/13 and has been designated as archaeological site 41DL279-were performed by the Archaeology Research Program, Southern Methodist University. The field investigations comprised three phases of work: (1) the machine-assisted removal of relatively recent overburden from the site's historical component; (2) archaeological testing of the exposed nineteenth-century landscape conducted by Freese and Nichols Inc., under Texas Antiquities Permit 671, Susan Andrews, Principal Investigator; and (3) intensive mitigation excavations conducted by the Archaeology Research Program, Southern Methodist University, under Texas Antiquities Permit 671-A, Randall W. Moir and David H. Jurney, Co-Principal Investigators for the project's field phase. This report was written, edited, and produced by the Archaeology Research Program, Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute, Mercyhurst College, under the direction of J. M. Adovasio, Ph.D., Principal Investigator for the project. These archaeological investigations at 41DL279, which are the first to be conducted within the Central Business District of Dallas, Texas, indicate that significant historic and prehistoric archaeological deposits are preserved under urban fills in portions of the city. The investigations reported herein identified and assessed material culture remains, building remnants, and support structures associated with the Dallas's formative period, beginning in the late 1840s or 1850s and extending through the Civil War and Reconstruction into the first decade of the railroad's presence in 1870s Dallas. Specific features in this landscape include: the foundation remains of original block subdivision fences and ditches made by John Neely Bryan sometime between 1844 and 1849; at least two dwellings and a well dating ca. 1853-1856 which are associated with the prominent early Dallas family of the French immigrant Maxime Guillot; the back yards and privies of African American slaves(?), tenants, and laundresses on lots owned by another prominent family, that of George and Mary Baird; and three fences separating the lots occupied by these individuals. The material culture deposits represent serial domestic occupations from ca. 1850 to ca. 1882. The report also describes and discusses several features associated with the machine-stripped deposits which overlay the ca. 1850-1882 component. These later features-attributed a stoneworks dating to the 1890s and rail yards dating ca. 1882-present-include two privies from this early industrial phase of Dallas's urban development. The temporal span represented by these cultural deposits saw Dallas change from a quiet village to a thriving city.},

	abstract = {An archaeological survey of the 66 acres (26.7 ha) enclosing the historic DeGolyer Estate and Arboretum, Dallas, Texas was undertaken by Southern Methodist University's Archaeology Research Program in 1988 and 1989. The survey was conducted in two phases for the Dallas Parks and Recreation Department under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 693. The fieldwork was carried out in order to locate and evaluate archaeological resources within the park that might be impacted by future construction and land alteration under the 1987 Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden Master Development Plan. The DeGolyer Estate is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) for its architectural qualities and for its historical associations with Everette Lee DeGolyer (1886-1956), a prominent businessman and petroleum geologist. A review of the archaeological literature, existing site records, and pertinent historical documents identified no archaeological properties within the 66 acre (26.7 ha) tract. Fieldwork included systematic surface reconnaissance, shovel testing, and an evaluation of backhoe trenches.

Nine backhoe trenches and 236 shovel test units were excavated. The pedestrian reconnaissance and systematic shovel testing program resulted in the discovery of three Historic period sites, four Historic period localities and four isolated finds of Historic period artifacts ranging in age from approximately 1870 to the mid-twentieth century. No evidence of prehistoric sites or isolated prehistoric remains (i.e., stone flakes, fire-cracked rock, etc.) were encountered. None of the historic archaeological sites, localities or isolated finds are regarded as potentially significant due to their poor integrity, insignificant historical context, or low potential to yield important information. Consequently, these findings indicate that the Arboretum does not contain any archaeological resources considered potentially significant or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and development under the Master Development Plan may proceed.},

One hundred thirty sites were located. Testing, consisting of surface collection, postholes, and/or test pits, was conducted at 65 of the sites located during survey. The purpose of this work was to assess the archaeological resources of the reservoir and to make recommendations for mitigation.

Occupation of the reservoir spans the Archaic (3500 B.C. to A.D. 500), Neo-American (A.D. 500 to 1650), and Historic (A.D. 1650 to the present) periods. Locational analysis demonstrated that sites with predominantly lithic assemblages are located mostly along and within Lake Fork floodplain, and sites with predominantly ceramic assemblages are located primarily along tributaries of Lake Fork Creek.Two models of prehistoric subsistence-settlement systems are offered to explain the distribution of lithic and ceramic sites. Thirteen sites are recommended for further work in order to mitigate the ad-verse impact upon the archaeological resources by reservoir inundation.},

	abstract = {This report contains the results of intensive testing of two locations on the Taylors Bayou drainage system in Jefferson County, Texas.

The two sites, designated 41JF35 and 41JF11 in Aten's survey, were investigated in August, 1981.

Only on location, 41JF11, contained unambiguous cultural materials. Diagnostic ceramic and lithic remains found there can be used to infer occupation of the site circa 1000-1300 A.D. Two separate shell lenses of Rangia cuneata at 41JF11 produced radiocarbon dates of 2490 +/- 60 and 420 +/- 50 radiocarbon years, respectively. The cultural materials were found within this latter shell lens. Previous dredging of the bayou adjacent to the site and erosion have reduced the site to less than 100 sq m in surface extension. Site 41JF35 had a single shell lens that radiocarbon dated to 2610 +/- 60 year. The site was judged to be of questionable cultural origin since no unambiguous cultural artifacts were found.

Further excavation at site 41JF11 could probably produce additional pieces of information, but the conclusions that could be drawn from any new data would not differ substantially from those contained in this report. Further, the cost of recovering any additional data would exceed that already expended on the site since we have exhausted the potential of high probability areas. Therefore, it is our recommendation that no further work be done on either site and that the drainage and flood control project proceed as planned.

Neither site is significant as defined by the criteria of eligibility for inclusion in the National Register.},

	abstract = {The Kirbyville, Texas Flood Protection Project necessitated a cultural resources reconnaissance in order to determine the impact of projected construction of channels on potential cultural resources in the Kirbyville area. This report is a detailed description and analysis of the reconnaissance survey carried out in August, 1981 by Rio Grande Associates of Houston, contractor, and the Archaeological Research Program of Southern Methodist University of Dallas, subcontractor. There were four aspects to this research: 1) on-the-ground archaeological survey, 2) a survey of literature concerning the prehistory and history of the area, 3) interviews with local amateur archaeologists and artifact collectors, and 4) interviews with informants knowledgeable of the historic period of Kirbyville and Jasper County.

The survey area for the Kirbyville Flood Protection Project was determined to be a corridor 50 meters wide on either side of Trout and Pin Oak Creeks in the area to be impacted by the proposed project. The survey teams excavated non-uniform sized, non-screened units in high probability locations, or locations where questions concerning the nature of the alluvial deposits arose. Survey teams commonly were cutting through briars, wading through streams, or, rarely, walking confortably under a high tree canopy. Some areas were simply impassable, and the survey was conducted from the middle of the stream.

Five prehistoric sites were found just outside the survey area (41JP84-41JP88), one of which (41JP84) may actually be marginal to the proposed impact area. Shovel testing revealed no cultural materials at this site, however. Only one of the remaining four sites has a high probability of containing cultural resources, but visual inspection did not reveal any trace of such resources.

No historice structures or sites were located within the project area. Our research has led us to believe that these is virtually no probability that an undetected historic site exists within the project area. No site in the project area meets the minimal requirements of eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places.

Much modern activity, including channelization and the installation of power lines, has disturbed the project area. Due to the possibility of buried prehistoric sites, it is recommended that limited archaeological monitoring be conducted during the construction phase. This is particularly important in the lower portion of Trout Creek, below U.S. Highway 96 bridge. This area holds the highest potential for such buried sites.},

Finally, data recovery was initiated on the earliest historic component at 41FT89, the Eldridge and Eliza Bottoms Farmstead occupied from ca. 1856 to 1868.},

The expanded commerce between the United States and Mexico has made the present border facilities inadequate to efficently handle the expanded intercountry trade traffic. Therfore, GSA is implementing a multi-phase construction program to upgrade the present facilities. The acquisition of a section of land owned by the City of Brownsville for an extensive expansion of the U.S. Custom Inspection Docks and Administration facilities at the International Gateway Bridge Border Crossing, necessitated archeological testing to determine whether extant and intact cultural and/or structural materials still existed under the present ground surface. Archeological investigations prior to the demolition of a 30,000 square feet convention pavilion with associated parking lots and green areas was considered advisable as no previous archeological work had been done within the area of proposed construction. Archeological testing concentrated in green areas located around the pavilion and a south extension of the subject property. Historic information and archeological data have been combined to provide a documentary and material record of this area of Fort Brown for the 143 years of human occupation.},

With little exception, the skeleton is complete, and anthropometric measurements are not at variance with other Trans-Pecos examples.
